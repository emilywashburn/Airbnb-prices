# Airbnb-prices

We look at Airbnb data from several Europen countries.

Use python to clean and merge the data into one dataframe.

Create a database in postgre to store the data.

Use flask to call the data from the database.

Using JavaScript create a website with map and charts that displays information on Airbnb rentals and reviews based on selected city.
